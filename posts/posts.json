Luckily one exists for R already - the Lahman\ndataset. In fact, there’s even an R package available for it thanks\nto Chris Dalzell and his\nteam. Let’s use this dataset to figure out if homerun rates are high\nnow compared to historical data. First, what’s the average rate of home\nruns per plate appearance over time? Checking the data…\n\n\n\nIt looks like the rate increases over time, but it’s noisy data.\nLet’s check if the time series is stationary. We can use the Augmented\nDickey-Fuller test from the tseries\npackage.\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  .\nDickey-Fuller = -2.71, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.287\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\nBased on this results (p-value > 0.05), we can conclude that there\nis a trend, and home run rates have been increasing overall in the past\n70 years or so.\n\n\n\n",

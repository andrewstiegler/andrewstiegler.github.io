Here’s a look at\nJudge’s homeruns against games played this season.\n\n\n\nIt looks like a fairly linear slope, so I’ll add a linear trendline\nand check the fit. I’ll also add Bonds’s record-breaking season to the\nplot.\n\n\n\nThe linear regression has a correleation coefficient of about 0.99,\nso it’s a pretty good fit. Based on the linear model, Judge will end up\nwith ~68.9 home runs for the year. I’ll also add a few of the other top\nhome run seasons for comparison.\n\n\nName\n\n\nHome Runs\n\n\nYear\n\n\nBarry Bonds\n\n\n73\n\n\n2001\n\n\nMark McGwire\n\n\n70\n\n\n1998\n\n\nSammy Sosa\n\n\n68\n\n\n1998\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nDrafting Magic: The Gathering (or anything, really) requires you to\npredict in advance the best picks for what you need. It’s not easy to\nknow in advance if you’ve made the right pick or not. Thanks to the team\nover at 17lands, we can use the\naggregated data of everyone who has installed their tracker to rate MTG\ncards. One thing that’s nice about this data is that there is data for\npick priority, as well as in-game performance for each card. The\nsimplest ways of thinking about this are using the two metrics of\n“average taken at” (ATA), and “game-in-hand win-rate” (GIH WR). These\nmetrics describe when a card is picked on average, and how often a card\nwins on average when it’s actually in hand at some point in the game.\nHere’s a plot of ATA against GIH WR, using the latest available draft\nset, Dominaria United:\n\n\n\nYou can mouse-over the plot and see the card names. Cards above the\nline are better than you’d expect from their pick rate. This makes sense\nwith excellent cards (like Archangel of\nWrath). Cards below the line are worse than you’d expect (sorry Urza\nAssembles the Titans).\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nMagic the Gathering: Arena is an online client for playing the\ncollectable card game Magic the Gathering (MTG). One of the most popular\nMTG formats is Booster Draft - players open booster packs, build their\ndecks, and play until reaching either 7 wins or 3 losses. Depending on\nyour record at the end of the event, you receive rewards. MTG:A Premier\ndrafts have the following payout structure:\n\n\nWins\n\n\nGems\n\n\nPacks\n\n\n7\n\n\n2200\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n1800\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n1600\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n1400\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n1000\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n250\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n100\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n50\n\n\n1\n\n\nHowever, you can’t just use your win rate to calculate expected value\nfrom this event. That’s because the “first to 7 wins or 3 losses” format\nresults in lower-than-expected event win rates for a given game\nwin-rate. Consider the following sequence of games:\n\n\nGame 1\n\n\nGame 2\n\n\nGame 3\n\n\nGame 4\n\n\nGame 5\n\n\nW\n\n\nW\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nW\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nW\n\n\nWhile both sequences end up with 2 wins and 3 losses, the second\nsequence’s final win wouldn’t be counted, as you’d be eliminated after\nthe 3rd loss, and you’d only get 100 gems (compared to 250 gems in the\nfirst sequence). Let’s simulate this event structure at different win\nrates to see what the payouts are like. We’ll simulate 3000 events\n(sequences ending at 7 wins or 3 losses) for various winrates. Then\nwe’ll calculate the expected gem payout, considering a premier draft\ncosts 1500 gems to enter.\n\n\n\nFrom this, you can see you need a single-game win percentage of over\n65% before you can expect to break even on premier drafts in MTG: Arena.\nHere’s a table with the expected outcomes for gems and packs for\ndifferent winrates:\n\n\nSingle-game Win%\n\n\nAverage Net Gems\n\n\nAverage Packs\n\n\n0.30\n\n\n-1217.89\n\n\n1.4380\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n-1094.41\n\n\n1.6656\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n-989.63\n\n\n1.8668\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n-845.99\n\n\n2.1464\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n-664.64\n\n\n2.5292\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n-499.89\n\n\n2.9018\n\n\n0.60\n\n\n-308.27\n\n\n3.3344\n\n\n0.65\n\n\n-121.53\n\n\n3.7904\n\n\n0.70\n\n\n87.78\n\n\n4.3234\n\n\n\n\n\n",

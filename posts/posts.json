    "contents": "\nMagic the Gathering: Arena is an online client for playing the\ncollectable card game Magic the Gathering (MTG). One of the most popular\nMTG formats is Booster Draft - players open booster packs, build their\ndecks, and play until reaching either 7 wins or 3 losses. Depending on\nyour record at the end of the event, you receive rewards. MTG:A Premier\ndrafts have the following payout structure:\n\n\nWins\n\n\nGems\n\n\nPacks\n\n\n7\n\n\n2200\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n1800\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n1600\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n1400\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n1000\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n250\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n100\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n50\n\n\n1\n\n\nHowever, you can’t just use your win rate to calculate expected value\nfrom this event. That’s because the “first to 7 wins or 3 losses” format\nresults in lower-than-expected event win rates for a given game\nwin-rate. Consider the following sequence of games:\n\n\nGame 1\n\n\nGame 2\n\n\nGame 3\n\n\nGame 4\n\n\nGame 5\n\n\nW\n\n\nW\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nW\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nW\n\n\nWhile both sequences end up with 2 wins and 3 losses, the second\nsequence’s final win wouldn’t be counted, as you’d be eliminated after\nthe 3rd loss, and you’d only get 100 gems (compared to 250 gems in the\nfirst sequence).\nLet’s simulate this event structure at different win rates to see\nwhat the payouts are like. We’ll simulate 3000 events (sequences ending\nat 7 wins or 3 losses) for various winrates. Then we’ll calculate the\nexpected gem payout, considering a premier draft costs 1500 gems to\nenter.\n\n\n\nFrom this, you can see you need a single-game win percentage of about\n65% before you can expect to break even on premier drafts in MTG:\nArena.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nHow have home run rates changed? Are there more homeruns now than\never?\nIn order to look at baseball data in R, we need a good baseball\ndatabase. Luckily one exists for R already - the Lahman\ndataset. In fact, there’s even an R package available for it thanks\nto Chris Dalzell and his\nteam. Let’s use this dataset to figure out if homerun rates are high\nnow compared to historical data. First, what’s the average rate of home\nruns per plate appearance over time? Checking the data…\n\n\n\nIt looks like the rate increases over time, but it’s noisy data.\nLet’s check if the time series is stationary. We can use the Augmented\nDickey-Fuller test from the tseries\npackage.\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  .\nDickey-Fuller = -2.71, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.287\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\nBased on this results (p-value > 0.05), we can conclude that there\nis a trend, and home run rates have been increasing overall in the past\n70 years or so.\n\n\n\n",
